## About

This project came about as an excuse to stretch my mental muscles. My interest in Java/JavaFX has recently been piqued (again) and I have decided to undergo another project. Well, that's not entirely accurate. I have decided to try and complete this project.

I have not received any formal development training&mdash;well outside of a course at the university many moons ago. I do not have a graduate degree in `Computer Science`. I have read a few books, perused **many** online tutorials, and Googled a metric *ton* to get where I am today.

Therefore, the game of Blackjack is what I believed to be a relatively easy project to undertake. A project that could leak into many facets of Java and where the business rules (game logic) are well-known, available, and thoroughly documented.

I'm always looking for feedback and helpful hints. Please do not hesitate to submit a `pull request` with a better (or more modern) way to do things.

## Getting Started

To get started, all you will need to do is `clone` this repository into the <abbr title="Integrated Develpoment Environment">IDE</abbr> of your choice. Most popular, at least in my extensive research, are as follows:

* [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
* [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)
* [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Should I also mention [Netbeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/download/index.html)?

### Prerequisites

1. JRE 12
2. JavaFX 12

### Installation

All you will need to do is build the project in your IDE and run the `.jar` file

## Usage

Perhaps I'll add some screenshots and instructions on how to play the game. Although, I believe it is pretty intuitive.

## Contributing

Submit a `pull request` on GitHub and I'll consider it for integration.
